                    Welcome to the Middle Boys Section, a place where curiosity turns into confidence and effort turns into achievement.
                    These are the years that shape not just knowledge, but character — where our students learn to think critically,
                    work collaboratively, and believe in their own potential. Our dedicated teachers walk alongside every child,
                    encouraging them to ask bold questions, embrace challenges, and grow into responsible, compassionate individuals.
                    I am proud to lead a team that nurtures both minds and hearts, and I invite every student in this section to
                    dream big, work hard, and know that we are with them every step of the way.
